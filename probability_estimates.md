## Summary of Estimated Score

With these revised probabilities, an "average" 20-year-old student would likely check **25 to 35** boxes. 
Expected Score: **115 to 125** (Pure range).

This reflects a modern college experience where students are more digitally connected but physically and legally more cautious than their predecessors in the 1980s.
