  The New and Improved 1988 Rice Trasher Purity Test

  There's no doubt in anyone's mind that the old Purity Test, first printed in this very paper, is an
  enduring classic which should still be mandatory for all entering freshmen. However, it has been noted
  that the test is perhaps a little outdated. With this in mind, we at the backpage are proud to offer the
  new, improved, 1988 Purity Test.

  Instructions: For each of the following things you have done, give yourself one point. When you're done,
  subtract the total from 150. This is your score. "MOS" means "member of the opposite sex". "Sexual
  activity" means either sexual intercourse or heavy activity with both (or all) parties naked and with
  orgasm as the ultimate goal. This is in response to complaints that intercourse is not always the most
  reliable indicator of purity.

  Administrative Approval of the Trasher Purity Test

  To the members of the Rice University Community:
  In my continuing efforts to make myself known as a hip dude capable of jiving with the average Rice cat, I
  have consented to take the so-called Purity Test that I have been hearing about so much in the last
  fifteen years or so. Of course, it was against my better judgment to participate in such shenanigans; a
  highly respected university official such as myself is not supposed to lower his standards. Still, I can
  rock and roll with the best of them and after looking through this very comprehensive, and often rather
  disgusting, list, I am very pleased to announce publicly that I have felched a member of the same sex. We
  would have done all of that kissy-kissy poop, but he had such a lisp that I didn't want to get anywhere
  near his mouth. Plus I don't think he had washed his hair in recent memory. Yuck!

  No wonder Hanszen is such a hurting college.
