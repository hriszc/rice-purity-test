# Rice Purity Test Score Percentile Rankings (Correlation Adjusted v2)

### Methodology: Latent Variable Simulation
This model accounts for the high correlation between behaviors. We used a latent factor model with correlation **rho=0.85**. In this realistic model, people tend to progress through experiences in a somewhat ordered fashion (e.g., kissing leads to more intense activities). The previous 'independent' model resulted in scores unnaturally clustered around the mean (SD ~3); this new model shows a much more realistic spread (SD ~20+).

## Summary Statistics
- **Expected (Mean) Score:** 128.26
- **Median Score:** 136
- **Standard Deviation:** 22.76
- **Analysis:** You can see that scores are now distributed across a wide range, better representing the diversity of college lifestyles.
